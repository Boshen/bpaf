? This example implements a tri-state switch: wether decision was made
? positive, negative or not at all. Alternative implementation can use
? [`optional`](Parser::optional) and `None` to indicate "no decision" case.
? A case with positive decision:
> --on
OK
Options { decision: On }

? A case with no decision:
>
OK
Options { decision: Undecided }

? `--on` and `--off` are mutually exclusive:
> --on --off
Stderr
"--off" cannot be used at the same time as "--on"

? help
> --help
Stdout
Usage: [--on | --off]

Available options:
        --on    Positive decision
        --off   Negative decision
    -h, --help  Prints help information
