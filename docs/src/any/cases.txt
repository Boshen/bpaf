? Capture `--turbo` flag for internal use and return everything else as is so it can be passed
? to some other program. Anything except for `--turbo` here and in following examples is
? consumed by `any`
> --turbo git commit -m "hello world"
OK
Options { turbo: true, rest: ["git", "commit", "-m", "hello world"] }

? Or just capture and return everything
> git commit -m "hello world"
OK
Options { turbo: false, rest: ["git", "commit", "-m", "hello world"] }

? Doesn't have to be in order either
> git commit -m="hello world" --turbo
OK
Options { turbo: true, rest: ["git", "commit", "-m=hello world"] }
