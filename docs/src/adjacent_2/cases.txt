? You can chain one or more commands, commands can be arbitrarily nested too
> eat fastfood drink --coffee sleep --time=5
OK
Options { switch: false, commands: [Eat("fastfood"), Drink(true), Sleep(5)] }


? You can pass other flags after all the commands but not in between them
? since commands are treated as positionals. It should be possible to consume
? items before and between commands as well if they are consumed before the commands
? like this: `construct!(Options { switch, commands })` but in that case you need
? to be careful about not consuming anything from the command themselves.
> sleep --time 10 eat "Bak Kut Teh" drink -s
OK
Options { switch: true, commands: [Sleep(10), Eat("Bak Kut Teh"), Drink(false)] }
